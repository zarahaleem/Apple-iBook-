# *iBook G4*

From 1999, Computer designed, manufactured and sold a line of laptop computers called iBook. With less expensive costs and lower specs than Apple's higher-end PowerBook laptop brand, the line catered to the entry-level, consumer, and educational markets.

One of these computer laptops was the iBook G4. Launched in October 2003, it was the last of it's line and finally ended Apple's use of the PowerPC G3 chip.
